        <p class="introp">The perfect picnic is when you find a lush grassy spot to lay down on, preferably under a shade. You eat all your snacks like cheese and crackers, sandwhiches, cake, fruits, and then listen to music or read a book. Afterwards you take a nap until the dinner rolls around.</p>
        <h1 class="rule1">1. Bring something to sit on</h1>
        <p class="section1">It's pretty rare to find clean lush grass in the city so it's best to bring some chairs or a matt (unless you want dirty pants). When it's a picnic by yourself, just bring a matt! If you feel a little fancy bring a chair! If you're with a group, bring multiple chairs and have party! I like bring matts because they're easier to carry and travel with. Also, matts are better to nap on than chairs.</p>

        <p class="section2">Picnics are always fun when you have snacks and drinks! The best picnic food would be finger foods like cheese and crackers. Or even meals like sandwhiches, bread and tomatos, pasta, just put it in your lunch box. Basically foods that can last a long time and does not need to be chilled. Drinks are also super fun especially when drinking out of a cool mug. It would be pretty hard to carry around because it's so fragile but you could use plastic ones too. The ceramics are just too pretty not to take out though.</p>
        <h1 class="rule3">3. Find a spot</h1>
        <p class="section3">Now that you have all the essentials, it's time to go outside and find that nice little piece of grass. Don't always settle for the first sight!</p>
